# Resource-allocation-in-5g-network-using-KNN

0The work focuses on improving resource allocation in 5G networks by classifying network slices using KNN based on network quality. It dynamically adjusts QoS and allocates bandwidth in real-time, based on the predicted network slice class and traffic demand, ensuring efficient and responsive resource management for high-demand applications![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eedbbb7-fe19-4950-92b3-9036ac9e9a6a)
